# CalamityBuilds

# *NOT COMPLETE YET*
Simple Calamity addon that removes the hassle of constantly alt-tabbing for builds and item recommendations by appending a 'Recommended for: ' tooltip to recommended class weapons and armor for your current boss/stage of progression. Currently it is only for weapons, but armor and accessories will be added

The recommendations are pulled from https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:Class_setups




## Planned Features

- UI interface
- Track your progression stage and filter accordingly
- Be able to choose class to filter unneccesarry items
- Additional comments to items (i.e. "Favorable for Higher DPS", "Used with X accessory", etc.)
- ~Dynamically change the progression stage in the tooltip/UI~
